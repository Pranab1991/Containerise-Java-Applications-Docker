# Containerization of java applications using docker

# Introduction
This project is an effort to containerise an Java application using Docker.

Containerization is defined as a form of operating system virtualization, through which applications are run in isolated user spaces called containers, all using the same shared operating system (OS).

The approach taken involves packaging of java application while generating the container. This particular step can be preponed and the process of containerization can be eased up.
